# Olympiad Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a plethora of algorithmic problems that come mainly from 3 online judges:

* [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) - 400+ problems
* [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/) - 200+ problems
* [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt) - 850+ problems

## Structure

The files are separated in folders according to the judge. Each file has the name of the problem it is meant to solve plus the extension of the language it uses (C++ or Python). In addition, each file has a header that links to the problem it solves.

## About the solutions
Most solutions were coded between Mid 2016 and Late 2018. They were inteded as a training for the [Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/) and the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://ioinformatics.org/index.shtml). These solutions might be helpful to future competitors, so I am sharing them as a form of reference.

Because the solutions were meant for competitions, they **do** contain software practices that should be avoided. Global variables are frequent in the codes, all the C++ librarys are imported and most of the code is not commented. The readers should keep this is mind and be aware that they should not code like that outstide programming contests.  

## About the author

I have participated in many programming competitions, such as the International Olympiad in Informatics, the Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics, the Ibero-American Contest in Informatics and ICPC PacNW.
